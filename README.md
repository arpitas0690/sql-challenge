#SQL Challenge

#For this project, I am researching the people whom this commpany employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
# I have designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. 

#The sql schema file contains the space where I entered all the tables.
#The queries file contains all of the answers to the questions related to the data. 

#You can also find a diagram of which variables I used to connect each of the files in the screenshot in the repository.
